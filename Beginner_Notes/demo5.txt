To format the results pretty() is used

db.collection.find().pretty()


Find Data
There are 2 methods to find and select data from a MongoDB collection, find() and findOne().

1.find()
--------
To select data from a collection in MongoDB, we can use the find() method.

This method accepts a query object. If left empty, all documents will be returned.

db.collection.find()

db.posts.find()

2.findOne()
------------
To select only one document, we can use the findOne() method.

This method accepts a query object. If left empty, it will return the first document it finds.

Note: This method only returns the first match it finds.

db.collection.findOne()

Querying Data
-------------------
To query, or filter, data we can include a query in our find() or findOne() methods.

Example
db.posts.find( {category: "News"} )

Projection
-------------
Both find methods accept a second parameter called projection.

This parameter is an object that describes which fields to include in the results.

Note: This parameter is optional. If omitted, all fields will be included in the results.

***Notice that the _id field is also included. This field is always included unless specifically excluded.

We use a 1 to include a field and 0 to exclude a field.***

db.clients.find({'clinet_id':1},{'name':1,'industry':1})

**You cannot use both 0 and 1 in the same object. The only exception is the _id field. 
You should either specify 
the fields you would like to include or the fields you would like to exclude.**
