In MongoDB, a database is not actually created until it gets content!

Way 1: You can create a collection using the createCollection() database method.

        db.createCollection("posts")

Way 2: You can also create a collection during the insert process.

        db.posts.insertOne(object)


***We are here assuming object is a valid JavaScript object containing post data:***
***This will create the "posts" collection if it does not already exist.

Remember: In MongoDB, a collection is not actually created until it gets content!***
