To retrieve elements from collection find() is used

db.Collections.find()

To select data from a collection in MongoDB, we can use the find() method.

This method accepts a query object. If left empty, all documents will be returned.


2. findOne()
--------------
To select only one document, we can use the findOne() method.

This method accepts a query object. If left empty, it will return the first document it finds.

Note: This method only returns the first match it finds.

---------------------------------- 
Querying Data
To query, or filter, data we can include a query in our find() or findOne() methods.

Example
db.posts.find( {category: "News"} )
